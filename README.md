PressVisualization
==================

Press Visualization is a general tool for visualizing topic model outputs for large dataset. 
The common situation where we have a group of users, each of them associate with their own set of documents (produced pediodically, timely). Running topic model algorithms on this kind of data produces interesting results.
These results are presented using this tool.

Pleas send any bugs reports or questions to Thang Nguyen (daithang@umiacs.umd.edu).

Prepare data
------------

This application assumes that you have the outputs from topic model already loaded into mysqlite, please check [myrepo] (https://github.com/daithang1111/myrepo) on how to generate these tables.
